sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: The algorithm can execute the search almost as fast as the Merge sort, however, for larger files it does require more time.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: This is made evident from the fact that it is the most efficient algorithm, it requires less time for execution.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: This algorithm has fairly similar execution timings irrespective of the sorted file, it must therefore be taking the same number of steps.
The execution time on this algorithm is identical no matter the file to be sorted what indicates that the algorithm takes the same number of steps.
